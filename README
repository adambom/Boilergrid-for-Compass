	    This is a mashup of Paul Irish's HTML5 boilerplate, which is a badass, bullet-proof, and future-ready html 5 and css template that makes your shit work nice, with the blueprint grid system, which helps you create grid based layouts. It's all built in SCSS (.scss file ext) (a.k.a SASS - or syntactically awesome stylesheets), which is backwards compatible with sass (.sass file ext) and css. It's all rolled up using the compass framework (compass-style.org). Since the code uses blueprint/semantic, you can make finally make your grid-based layouts semantic. No more span-10 classes in your markup. This is accomplished using the column, prepend, append, last, etc. mixins.
