	        grid system, which helps you create grid based layouts. It's all built in SCSS (.scss file ext) 
	        (a.k.a SASS - or syntactically awesome stylesheets), which is backwards compatible with sass 
	        (.sass file ext) and css. It's all rolled up using the compass framework (compass-style.org). 
	        Since the code uses blueprint/semantic, you can make finally make your grid-based layouts 
	        semantic. No more span-10 classes in your markup. This is accomplished using the column, 
	        prepend, append, last, etc. mixins.",

//////////////////////////

I've set up a repo called Boilergrid, which is a nice semantic implementation of blueprint using compass. I've integrated Paul Irish's HTML5 boilerplate for cross-browser, optimized markup.

Add all of your styles in scss or css in /css/src/partials/_main.scss

Set the width of blueprint elements like column width, grid width, and gutter width in /css/src/partials/_base.scss

when you want to specify column width for element #myelement, add the following scss to /css/src/partials/_main.scss:

    #myelement {
        @include column(number-columns) // where number-columns is the integer number of columns to span. Equivalent to class="span-numbercolumns".
    }

To prepend or append columns to an element use the @include append(number-columns), or @include prepend(number-columns) mixins. That is equivalent to class="prepend-numbercolumns".

To indicate the last column in a row, use the @include last mixin. This is equivalent to class="last". e.g.
    #myelement {
        @include last;
 	}
